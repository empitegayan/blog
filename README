What is it?
===========

Typo is a lean and mean weblog. Weblogs are cool, weblogs are "in" and everyone who writes
code has an different opinion on how a weblog should be written. Typo is our take on it.
Its meant for programmers who can extend and change the source to make it fit to their
needs but will eventually be useful to normal users as well.

Requirements
============

Currently you need all of those things to get typo to run:

 * Ruby -v of 1.8.2 (25-05-2004) or higher 
 * Rails. Most likely the latest version. If something
   doesn't work try to run gem update.
 * Redcloth. You can get it by running "gem install redcloth"
 
Installation
============

Unpack the tgz or zip in some directory.

The first decision you have to make is whether to use sqlite or mysql. Both are supported.
There is no reason why postgres or others shouldn't work, I just don't have a sql file for
them yet.

  * Create a database for typo. You can find matching schemas in teh db/ folder. 
    If you choose sqlite make sure to create the files using the db/schema.sqlite.sql 
    file.      
  * Change the config/database.yml to reflect your newly created database configuration  
  * Run script/server -e production and see if it works  
  * Point your browser to http://your.domain.com:3000/ and follow the install process

If you want to deploy on fastcgi you will need to follow the setup instructions on
the typo page at http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac.cgi/wiki/FastCgi

If you choose to go with sqlite you will need to create the databases. 

Customization
=============

Your first point of customization should be app/views/layouts/articles.rhtml. This is the
layout used for the weblog. You will see some commented out blocks which indicate on how
to use the syndication helpers.

Usage
======

Typo was made to be used from a desktop client. I personally use MarsEdit but all
metaweblog and movable type compatible clients will be able to talk to typo. For a short
list of clients which are confirmed to work please visit http://typo.leetsoft.com.
A real admin interface was added recently. You can find it under http://your.domain.com/admin
Most features of typo like sending of pingbacks still require the use of a desktop client 
with the moveable type api. 

Client setup
============

Set your desktop client to movable type api and enter http://your.domain.com/backend/xmlrpc 
as endpoint address.
