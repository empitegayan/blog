== About

Typo is a lean and mean weblog. Weblogs are cool, weblogs are in and everyone who writes
code has an different opinion on how a weblog should be written. Typo is my take on it.
Its meant for programmers who can extend and change the source to make it fit to their
needs but will eventually be useful to normal users as well.

== Requirements

Currently you need all of those things to get typo to run:

 * Ruby of version 1.8.1 or higher 
 * Rails. Most likely the latest version. If something
   doesn't work try to run gem update 
 * Redcloth. You can get it by gem install redcloth
== Installation

Unpack the tgz or zip in some directory.

The first decision you have to make is whether to use sqlite or mysql. Both are supported.
There is no reason why postgres or others shouldn't work, I just don't have a sql file for
them yet.

If you choose sqlite you can use the rake task create_sqlite to get the database files. 

1) Change the config/database.yml to reflect your configuration 
2) Change the config/config.yml for your setup 
3) Run script/server -e production and see if it works

If you want to deploy on fastcgi you will need to follow the setup instructions on
www.rubyonrails.com

== Customization

Your first point of customization should be app/views/articles/layout.rhtml. This is the
layout used for the weblog. You will see some commented out blocks which indicate on how
to use the syndication helpers.

== Useage

Typo was made to be used from a desktop client. I personally use MarsEdit but all
metaweblog and moveable type compatible clients will be able to talk to typo. For a short
list of clients which are confirmed to work please visit http://typo.leetsoft.com
