Goals for 4.1
-------------

* Clean up code. Remove redundant code and clean up code paths. Reduce call
  path depth where practical, so it's easier for people to follow how things
  work.

* Document code.  Make rdoc produce something useful for Typo.

* Reduce front-page query count to 4: triggers, blog, content count,
  front-page content.

* Speed up.

* Remove all calls to render_component.

* Move as many features as possible to Rails plugins.

* Optional automatic HTTPS redirection for admin/login.
