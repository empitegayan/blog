Changes
=======

* A new installer and a Typo .gem file.  Run 'gem install typo' and then
  'typo install /some/path' to install Typo.

* Text filter plugins, including easy inline Flickr image support and syntax
  highlighting for code.

* Enhanced feed support.  Atom 1.0 and RSS 2.0 are both supported.  Atom 0.3
  has been removed.  Both feed types have better UUIDs.  There are also 
  per-tag, -category, and -author feeds.  Most pages have their own 
  content-specific feeds available via feed autodiscovery.

* Tags.  The 'keywords' field in the Typo admin UI (as well as many blog 
  editors) has been commandeered to provide tagging for Typo.  Tags are
  separated by spaces (just like Flickr).  If you want to include a space
  in a tag, then use quotes.

* File uploads.  You can now upload images and other content directly from the 
  admin UI.

* Podcast support (experimental).

* Email and/or Jabber notification of new content, including comments and 
  trackbacks.

* Support for posting articles with a future posting date.  Pre-posted 
  articles don't appear on the blog or feeds until their posting date passes.

* A new cache system that automatically times out stale entries.  Several 
  types of content, including the Flickr sidebar, will automatically cause the
  page to be rebuilt every few hours to ensure freshness.

* Better theme support.  Some of this was back-ported to Typo 2.6.0.

* A redirect table to help users migrating to Typo.  You can enter new URLs
  into the Redirect table and Typo will look there whenever it doesn't 
  recognize a URL.  So you can move from Movable Type-style permalinks to
  Typo-style permalinks without losing the perma- in your links.

* Cleaner migrations.

* Rails 1.1 support.  Rails 1.1.4 is strongly recommended.  Rails 1.0 won't 
  work at all.

* Google sitemap support.

* Gravatars support for comments.

* Comment previews.

* Markup help for comments, articles, and pages.
