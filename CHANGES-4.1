This is a list of changes in Typo 4.1. This is aimed at developers and theme
creators, not end-users.

URL Generation
--------------

URLs are now generated based on the blog canonical_server_url, not the current
controller's base URL. This has a number of impacts:

  * If the canonical_server_url setting is wrong, most links will be broken.
  * We can now generate permalink URLs directly from models without needing a
    controller object.
  * We can (and have) removed all of the controllers parameters passed around 
    to text filters and notifiers.

We've added a number of methods for generating URLs directly from models. In
specific, all models that make sense have a 'permalink_url' method, and we're
adding methods like 'trackback_url' and 'feed_url' where they make sense.
There are *way* too many definitions of common URLs within Typo, and we're
moving all of them into the models.


Text Filters
------------

The text filter API has been overhauled. Since we no longer need a controller
object everywhere, we've been able to simplify the API substantially. We've
also moved text filters from the Rails components/ directory into Rails
plugins, in vendor/plugins/typo-textfilter-*. It should now be possible to
manage text filters using the usual plugin management mechanisms.


Helper Cleanup
--------------

A bunch of redundant helpers have been deprecated. Look at
app/helpers/application_helper.rb for a list. All calls to deprecated helpers
have been removed from the Typo tree, but some out-of-tree plugins and themes
may still call them. Watch Typo's log for deprecation warnings.

Here's a partial list of what's been removed:

  * ApplicationHelper.config_value(:foo): replace with this_blog.foo
  * ApplicationHelper.config[:foo]: replace with this_blog.foo
  * ApplicationHelper.server_url_for: just use url_for.
  * ApplicationHelper.url_of(item): use item.permalink_url
  * ApplicationHelper.*_url(item): use item.permalink_url
  * XmlHelper.*_link(item): use item.permalink_url


Removal of body_html and friends
--------------------------------

The content table's body_html and extended_html fields are gone. They've
always been a bit odd, because they're a cache of text_filter(body) and
text_filter(extended). They've moved out of the database and into the fragment
cache. As a practical measure users shouldn't see a difference, however the
body_html and extended_html methods have been deprecated; use html(:body) or
html(:extended).
